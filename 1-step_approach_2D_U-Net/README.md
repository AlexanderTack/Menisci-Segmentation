# Menisci-Segmentation 1-step approach

The "1-step approach" is based on a 2D U-Net. This 2D U-Net is employed for the segmentation of sagittal weDESS MRI slices from the OAI database (https://oai.epi-ucsf.org/datarelease/).

The 2D U-Net was trained on manual segmentations provided by Imorphics (Manchester, UK).
These manual gold standard segmentations are publicly available as part of the OAI database (https://oai.epi-ucsf.org/datarelease/iMorphics.asp).
All networks were trained on the baseline segmentation masks only.

Weights are supplied at https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-zib/frontdoor/index/index/docId/6748 for the following networks.
