# This program is segmenting the menisci from 3D waterexcited dual-echo steady-state MRIs.
#
# The code is loosely based on the code developed by Marko Jocic and uploaded on github (https://github.com/jocicmarko/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation).
# Marko Jocic originally developed the code for the ultrasound segmentation challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation, MIT license).
